# Encryption-Decryption-Machine

RSA encryption is an important part of today’s world. It allows people to exchange information securely over the Internet without worrying about third parties eavesdropping on their communications. The way this method works is by making use of a public key and a private key. The public and private keys are “entangled”, so that they are always related to each other right from the moment they are created. However, it is extremely difficult (basically impossible with today’s computers) to infer a private key from a public key if both numbers are large enough.

This project is a simplified version of a real-world RSA encryption-decryption machine that:
- Creates an RSA key pair
- Encrypts using a public key
- Decrypts using a private key

The two files are Python scripts - one for encrypting nad one for decrypting.
